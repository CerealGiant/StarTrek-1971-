  ONE QUADRANT.  THEREFORE TO GET FROM
  QUADRANT 5,6 TO 5,5 YOU WOULD USE COURSE 3, WARP
  FACTOR 1. COORDINATES ARE SPECIFIED USING X,Y NOTATION
  WITH X 1-8 FROM LEFT-RIGHT AND Y 1-8 FROM TOP-BOTTOM.

COMMAND 1 = SHORT RANGE SENSOR SCAN
  PRINTS THE QUADRANT YOU ARE CURRENTLY IN, INCLUDING
  STARS, KLINGONS, STARBASES, AND THE ENTERPRISE; ALONG

  OF THE ENTERPRISE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCAN.  THE SCAN
  IS CODED IN THE FORM XXX, WHERE THE UNITS DIGIT IS THE
  NUMBER OF STARS, THE TENS DIGIT IS THE NUMBER OF STAR-
  BASES, THE HUNDREDS DIGIT IS THE NUMBER OF KLINGONS.

COMMAND 3 = PHASER CONTROL
